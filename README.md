Hello, my name is Burmau. I am a software engineer and a Computer Science Major in Uni.
This is my journey into the land of ruby and in this project(Phone book) i created a journal that does the following:

* I used the Devise gem to create user registration.

* I used bootstrap to decorate the frontend of the web App

* I used Sqlite as the database to store the users entries into the phone book app

# FUNCTIONALIES 

*   The ability of the user to sign in, sign up and out.

*   The app adheres to the CRUD functions and the user can perform those functions on their pages
